# SmatterPlot


SmatterPlot is a small, easy to use, charting software that enables users to quickly create charts with just a drag-and-drop!

Under Development:
SmatterPlot is not quite ready for prime time -- I'm still working on it.  But you might find it useful and you are welcome to try it out now.

Features Planned:
SmatterPlot will have a lot of features designed to make everything quick and easy.  When it's finished it will be the quickest way to make a plot from data whether it is in spreadsheet or simply copied from the web.  

Some planned Features include:

Instant chart with drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste.
AI-based chart design selection, so the user doesn't have to choose all the chart features -- they are just there immediately.
Instant title, axis and series labelling based on context.
Open data from a wide range of formats (.xlsx, .csv, .txt, etc.)
Generate charts in a wide range of image formats (.png, .jpg, .svg, .pdf, etc.)
Instant unit conversions right in the chart.
Instant zoom, pan, and resize.
Easy customization of colors, styles, sizes, symbols, lines, etc.
Easy sequencing of series with color, symbol, and line grouping.

Platforms:
SmatterPlot is being developed in FreePascal which enables us to write code once and then compile versions of it for many different operating systems.  For now, only a Windows version has been compiled, but when complete SmatterPlot will be available for Windows, MacOS, Android, IOS, ChromeOS, Linux Ubuntu, and Raspberry Pi.
