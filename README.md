SmatterPlot is a small, easy to use, charting software that enables users to quickly create charts with just a drag-and-drop!

Installation:
To install SmatterPlot for Windows, go to the "Windows Installer" folder above and download the file "SmatterPlot.exe".  Once downloaded, execute this file from your download folder by double-clicking it.  Follow the prompts to install the software.  After installation you may start the software which typically will be accessible from a shortcut on the desktop.

Under Development:
SmatterPlot is not quite complete -- I'm still working on it, but it is stable and functional.  You are welcome to try it out now.



Current features include:

*Instant chart with drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste.
*AI-based chart design selection, so the user doesn't have to choose all the chart features -- they are just there immediately.
*Instant title, axis and series labelling based on context.
*Instant overlay of multiple datasets.
Open data from a wide range of formats (.xlsx, .csv, .txt, etc.)
Generate charts in a wide range of image formats (.png, .jpg, etc.)
Export to Excel with a customized chart.
Export to python script with a customized MatPlotLib chart.
Instant unit conversions right in the chart.
Instant zoom, pan, and resize.
Easy customization of colors, styles, sizes, symbols, lines, etc.
Easy sequencing of series with color, symbol, and line grouping.
Easy mathematical transformations such as averaging, smoothing, sorting, model fitting, differentiating, integrating and statistical analysis.
Easy dataset management with splitting, combining, and reducing datasets.
Easy generation of randomized datasets.

Features Planned:
SmatterPlot will have a lot of features designed to make everything quick and easy.  When it's finished it will be the quickest way to make a plot from data whether it is in spreadsheet or simply copied from the web.  Plans for the future include:
More export options such as SVG and PDF.
More mathematical transformations.
More statistical tools.

Platforms:
SmatterPlot is being developed in FreePascal which enables us to write code once and then compile versions of it for many different operating systems.  For now, only a Windows version has been compiled, but when complete SmatterPlot will be available for Windows, MacOS, Android, IOS, ChromeOS, Linux Ubuntu, and Raspberry Pi.
